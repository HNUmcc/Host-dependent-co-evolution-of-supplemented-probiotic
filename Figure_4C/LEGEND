The relationships between the Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 and its correlated indigenous intestinal microbes were visualized by the networks in the human and mouse model. 
The nodes in different colors represented the Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082, the probiotic positively correlated species, the probiotic negatively correlated species, and the species indirectly correlated with the probiotic. 
The gradual color of the line represented the strength of the correlation between the two nodes, which calculated by the SpiecEasi method based on the CLR transformed microbial relative abundance.

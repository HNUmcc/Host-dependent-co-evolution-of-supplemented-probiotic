The number of SNPs of the Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 correlated species at different time points in the human and mouse model. 
In general, the SNPs' number of the Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 positively correlated species (orchid line) was significantly less than that negatively correlated species (orange line) in the human model, and more mutations were annotated in the species negatively correlated with the probiotic in the mouse model, but fewer mutations were annotated in the placebo group.

Phylogenetic tree constructed based on the SNPs of all Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 isolates. 
The different color bars represent the strains isolated from different time points, and the L. plantarum HNU082 was set as the root strain. 
The isolates were dominated by 22 SNPs during the probiotic colonization, especially in the first two time points of the human model.

The isolates phenotypic verification experiments related to the rhamnose utilization (up panel) and acid tolerance (bottom panel).  
It was indicated that 21 mutational isolates (100%) with SNP in Gene 1257 (annotated as bacterial alpha-L-rhamnosidase 6 hairpin glycosidase) were able to utilize the rhamnose faster than the original strain, and 16 mutational isolates (20.5%) with SNP in Gene 1717 (annotated as inner membrane protein response to acidic) had better performance in acid tolerance.

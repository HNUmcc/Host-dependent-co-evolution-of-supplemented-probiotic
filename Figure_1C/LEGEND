The number of SNPs detected at every sampling time point (including the day 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28) in human, mouse and zebrafish models (top panel). No significant difference in the number of SNPs at the end of the experiment was found among the three models. 
The mutation type of G-C to A-T was the most frequently detected in all three models, but the frequency of the mutation type of A-T to G-C was significantly higher in the zebrafish model than that in the other two models (bottom panel).
